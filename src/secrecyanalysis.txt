Low Entropy Plaintext: AABBCCAABBCCBBAABBAABBCCCCBBAAAA
Ciphertext (ECB): 700fa86f842e53266e87fd6674dfa947

High Entropy Plaintext: 8A9C1273DE9B01388AC2B4E5217A57E0
Ciphertext (ECB): bc44beaffea6e5bf4a04c7c39b56cf23

There is an obviously difference in entropy between the plaintexts.
But when encrypted, the entropy difference between the ciphertexts seem negligible, and both could be considered high entropy.
Therefore, the ciphertext doesn't reveal any information about the entropy of the plaintext, maintaining perfect secrecy.
